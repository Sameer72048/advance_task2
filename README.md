Overview of the Chat Application
Key Features
Real-Time Messaging: Utilizes WebSocket to enable real-time communication between the user and a bot. Messages are sent and received instantly.

User Interface:

A clean and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
Messages are displayed in a chat bubble format, distinguishing between user and bot messages.
An input field for users to type their messages, accompanied by a send button.
Automatic Scrolling: The chat container automatically scrolls to the bottom when new messages are added, ensuring that the latest messages are always visible.

Message Handling:

Messages are stored in a state array, allowing for dynamic updates to the chat interface.
The application handles both user and bot messages, updating the UI accordingly.
Structure
State Management:
messages: An array of message objects that keeps track of all messages exchanged in the chat.
inputValue: A string that holds the current value of the input field.
WebSocket Management:
A useRef hook is used to maintain a reference to the WebSocket connection, allowing for persistent communication.
Effects:
The useEffect hook is used to establish the WebSocket connection when the component mounts and to clean up the connection when it unmounts.
Another useEffect is used to scroll the chat container to the bottom whenever new messages are added.
User Interaction
Input Handling:
The application captures user input through an input field and updates the state accordingly.
When the user clicks the send button, the message is sent to the WebSocket server, and the input field is cleared.
Potential Improvements
Error Handling: Implement error handling for WebSocket operations and user message sending.

Loading Indicator: Add a visual indicator (e.g., "typing...") to show when the bot is processing a message.

Accessibility Enhancements: Improve accessibility features, such as using aria-live attributes for screen readers.

Input Validation: Ensure that user input is validated to prevent sending empty or invalid messages.

Message Timestamps: Include timestamps for each message to provide context on when messages were sent.

Reconnect Logic: Implement logic to automatically attempt to reconnect if the WebSocket connection is lost.

Styling Enhancements: Consider adding animations or transitions for a smoother user experience.
